                    <p>ARTIST: Red Velvet (SM Entertainment)<br>One of the more recent entries here. I always love really upbeat songs, but the reason its ranked 10 is partly due to how long it took for the melody to get stuck in my head, but otherwise its a fun song to listen to!</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: Wien Margarete (Love Live! Superstar!!)<br>It took me a while to fully appreciate this song too, but when I did it really started getting stuck in my head. The first time I watched the PV, I was really blown away by the visuals and animation, and it really set the tone for the character.</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: Zhong Lanzhu (Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Dōkōkai Yon-Koma)<br>link: <br>Lanzhu was always one of my favorite idols from the Love Live series ever since I listened to her other song "Queendom", so when this song came out in the anime, I was really happy and I really loved how the song captures Lanzhu's character.</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: Red Velvet (SM Entertainment)<br>The song just feels so magical and I love listening to it when I'm trying to cool down from work and stress. It feels like a perfect harmony of longing, fantasy, and sadness, and I just don't think I'll get tired of it anytime soon.</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: Aqours ft. Hatsune Miku (Love Live! Sunshine! & Mitchie M)<br>I really couldn't believe it the first time I found out Love Live and Miku had a collaboration, since they were some of my favorite music artists growing up and this felt like a dream come true for me. The song also captured the quirks and iconic styles in both love live and vocaloid music so well!</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: Tomorrow x Together (HYBE Labels)<br>It has strong vibes that remind me of the kind of songs I'd love listening to on the road, and the overall way the song is presented in the MV is just really nostalgic to me in some way. It's the kind of song I'd love singing along to alone in my room when no one is watching hehe.</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: LE SSERAFIM (HYBE Labels)<br>This song has been and still is stuck in my head ever since it first dropped. My friends could tell from experience how I kept singing the song at random. It's got such catchy choreography too and it's the type of song that once you hear just a snippet, the entire song is stuck in your head.</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: Tomorrow x Together (HYBE Labels)<br>It's hype but still somehow kind of chill and I just really love this kind of music. It's the kind of song I'd listen to when I'm feeling down and when I just want to have a good time, and the imagery and meanings behind the song just make it all the more meaningful to enjoy!</p>

                    <p>ARTIST: Red Velvet (SM Entertainment)<br>I absolutely love the song to bits. It's got a very elegant and magical vibe to it and it's one of my first choices to listen to whenever I'm working on something that really needs me to squeeze my creative juices out. It's amazing as well how they integrated a classical music piece here and the vocals from each of the members are the absolute cherry on top for the song!</p>

                    <p>Here's some of my thoughts on Genshin Characters I may or may not like too much!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>He's very cheeky and aggressive but I find it really charming, and the way the game handles his character is just really nice. I put in a lot of effort to get him in the game, so that's already a big sign of how much I like this character.</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/scararate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>He's such a comforting character! Not only his voice but his overall demeanor of being like a wise and patient guy who just goes with the flow and adapts with the situation. I aspire to reach this level of calmness in my life</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/kazurate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>She's so organized and put together. I admire how well she handles her work and her attention to detail to make sure everything is working so well. She's a figure I constantly look up to hehe.</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/keqrate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>She's overall one of the coolest characters in the game! She seems so carefree and fun, but beneath it is someone so caring and calculated, and the more time you spend with her the more you understand why she's called the lord of the sea!</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/beirate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>The reason I like him so much is actually very similar to Kazuha. He's got this very calm and comforting demeanor, and he'd probably outsmart you a lot in a teasing way but not make you feel bad about not getting things right away.</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/alberate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>He's ok, i guess. I don't feel too strongly about him, but I'd still like to have him in my roster. At this point I wouldn't complain if I lost my 50/50 pity to him.</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/dilucrate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>The moment he was first introduced to the game, I was absolutely hooked. I really like these sly, teasing kinda characters, but I guess with the less exposure he got with the progression of the game, he went down the rankings especially after more charas were introduced.</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/kaerate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>Literally the sweetest gentleman. I think his story of finding his resolve in another land and facing the struggles he had faced is one of the nicest and most heartwarming stories among the characters, espeically considering how big an impact he made to the Kamisato siblings.</p>
                    <img src="media/rates/thorate.png">
                </div>
                <div class="simpytex">
                    <p>Really cool and imposing and I think she was really effective for her role, and how she acts as Ei is so sweet and really gives her an lovable gap moe. I would've probably rated her higher if she had not been a tyrant.</p>

                    <p>Elegant, pretty, and very sweet. I love everything about her from the design, to her gameplay, and the way her personality is written. I wish I can give her more love and I'll do everything I can do level her up as she deserves.</p>

        <h4>What is Genshin Impact?</h4>
        <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world action-rpg game developed by Hoyoverse, which gained immense popularity over the pandemic due to its breathtaking game scenery, music, lovable characters, and enjoyable gameplay.</p>
        <h4>What is "simp" or the act of "simping"?</h4>
        <p>"Simp" is an internet slang that refers to a person who is willing to go through great lengths to achieve love or affection from someone unatainbale, and acting as such is referred to as simping. This is often used in a joking manner, especially among game-enthusiasts as game characters may be quite appealing or attractive, but in reality are unattainable outside the game.</p>
